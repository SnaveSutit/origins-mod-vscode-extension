title: Entity Condition
description: |-
  Entity Condition Types operate on an Entity, which also allows access to the world.
  These are available to be used in most powers in the condition object field (or entity_condition in other power/condition types), which restricts when a power is active.
  Type: 'origins:block_collision'
  - Checks whether the bounding box of the entity collides with any block.
type: object
required:
  - offset_x
  - offset_y
  - offset_z
properties:
  offset_x:
    description: 'By how much of the bounding box size should the box be offset in the X direction (e.g.: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset of exact width, 2 = offset of twice the width of the bounding box)'
    type: number

  offset_y:
    description: 'By how much of the bounding box size should the box be offset in the Y direction (e.g.: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset of exact height, 2 = offset of twice the height of the bounding box)'
    type: number

  offset_z:
    description: 'By how much of the bounding box size should the box be offset in the Z direction (e.g.: 0 = no offset, 1 = offset of exact depth, 2 = offset of twice the depth of the bounding box)'
    type: number
