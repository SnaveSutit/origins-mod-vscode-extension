description: |-
  Entity Action Types operate on an Entity. Some more specific actions only have an effect on more specific entity types (e.g. Exhaust (Entity Action Type) only works on a PlayerEntity, as other entities do not have a hunger bar). These are available to power/action types that provides a entity_action object field.
