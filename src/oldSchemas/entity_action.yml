  ## Entity Action Type
  Entity Action Types operate on an Entity. Some more specific actions only have an effect on more specific entity types (e.g. Exhaust (Entity Action Type) only works on a PlayerEntity, as other entities do not have a hunger bar). These are available to power/action types that provides a entity_action object field.
