      ### `$namespace:$fileName`
      Modifies how long the entity that has the power is immune to damage upon being damaged.

      By default, an entity has a "hurt ticks" value of 20. The entity will only receive damage again only if either their "hurt ticks" value is less than 10 or if they receive a damage with a higher value than the previous.
