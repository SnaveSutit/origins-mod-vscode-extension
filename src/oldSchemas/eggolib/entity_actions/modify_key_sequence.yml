  $namespace:$fileName
  Modifies the current key sequence of a power that uses the Action on Key Sequence (Power Type) present on the entity that invoked the action.
  Notes
  If index is less than or equal to -1, then it would refer to the last index of the current key sequence. Otherwise, if it's 0, then it would refer to the first index of the current key sequence.
  How each operation works
  - append - Adds the specified keys to the last index of the current key sequence.
  - insert - Inserts the specified keys to the specified index of the current key sequence.
  - prepend - Adds the specified keys to the first index of the current key sequence.
  - remove - Removes the specified keys from the current key sequence. If there are no keys specified, remove the key from the specified index instead.
  - set - Replace the current key sequence with the specified key sequence.
