  allow_random_unchoosable:
    description: |-
      Whether origins which are unchoosable (unchoosable field set to true in the origin file) should be included in the random option.

    type: boolean
    default: false

  default_origin:
    description: |-
      If set, the origin with this namespace and ID will automatically be chosen for a new player.
      If an orb of origin is used later on, the player will be able to choose another origin then and the default_origin will not apply.
      Could for example be used to make all players start as human, and then use the orb as a progression item to select an origin.
    $ref: ./types/identifier.json

      If set to true, this layer will automatically pick an origin for the player if only one option is available.
