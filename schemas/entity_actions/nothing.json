Some more specific actions only have an effect on more specific entity types (e.g. Exhaust (Entity Action Type) only works on a PlayerEntity, as other entities do not have a hunger bar). These are available to power/action types that provides a entity_action object field.\nType: 'origins:nothing'\n- Does nothing. Can be used as a backup in case an action is not optional in some place.",
