Namespace and path are separated with a colon. An identifier may only contain lower-case letters (a-z), digits (0-9), `-`, `_` and `.`. It can include at most a single colon (`:`) for separation. The path may contain `/` to indicate \"folders\", but the namespace may not.\n\nIf no namespace is specified, it will default to `minecraft`.\n\nRead more here: [Minecraft Wiki: Namespaced ID](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Namespaced_ID)\n\n\n",
